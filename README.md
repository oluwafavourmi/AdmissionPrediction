# AdmissionPrediction

### ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project is basically based on predicting the chances of a candidate gaining admission into college based on the folllowing criterias:
   # 1. GRE(Graduate Record Examination): 
    The GRE is a standadized test that is used for the admission to graduate programs in the US it measures vebal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical writing skills

  #  2. SOP(statement of Purpose): 
    It is a document that is commonly used for graduate programs in india and other countries, it is a document applicants use to introduce themselves to the admissions committee highlighting their strengths and weaknesses
    
  #  3. Cumulative Grade Point Average:
    This is a measure of a student's academic performance over the course of their studies. It is calculated by dividing the total number of grade points earned b y the total number of credit hours attempted.

In the sample I used for my model the candidate has:
    GRE of 337
    SOP of 3.0
    CGPA of 7.71
    based on all these criterias our model predicted that this person will likely be admitted
